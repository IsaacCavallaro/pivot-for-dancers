## About

Pivot For Dancers is a static website developed using React and styled with Tailwind CSS. The primary objective of this project was to recreate and redesign an existing website originally built with WordPress. By migrating to React and Tailwind CSS, the development team (currently just Isaac Cavallaro at the moment) aimed to achieve greater control over the website's layout and features. This transition not only provided a more dynamic and responsive user interface but also allowed for a streamlined and customizable development process. The result is an online community tailored for dancers, facilitating open conversations about career changes within the dance industry.
